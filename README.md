# Cardamom Disease Classification

## Overview

Cardamom Disease Classification is a deep learning-based project developed by our team to detect diseases in cardamom plants using image data. We leverage transfer learning by using the MobileNetV2 model — a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network — as the base model. Our system is trained on a curated cardamom disease dataset to accurately classify leaf diseases and help farmers take timely action.

- **Lightweight & Efficient**  
  The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices without compromising accuracy.

- **Custom Dataset**  
  Trained on a domain-specific dataset of cardamom leaf images, capturing various disease states and healthy samples.
